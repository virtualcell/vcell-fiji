## VCell's Introduction to Analysing Simulation Results in Fiji

---

[Virtual Cell](https://vcell.org/) is a 
comprehensive platform for modeling cell biological 
systems, and produces simulation results for these systems.

As another analysis avenue we have added the new N5
export file which takes spatial simulation results, and
allow it to be accessed remotely. This plugin can then
read these simulation results stored on our servers in
the N5 format, and open them within Fiji.
