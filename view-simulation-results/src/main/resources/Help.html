    <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
            The VCell (https://vcell.org/) application can export spatial simulation results into multiple formats, with
            .N5 (https://imagej.net/libs/n5) being one of them. N5 exports are
            stored remotely on VCell servers, allowing applications such as ImageJ
            to directly access the results of these simulations and perform analyses.
        </p>
    <h3>Export Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            Virtual Cell has special techniques for spatial simulation results so that they are visually compelling while accurate to their
            source data. Those automatic techniques are not implemented within this plugin, so if an export is visually different
            from VCell's please go to Image -> Adjust -> Brightness/Contrast, and adjust it to a point where it is similar.
        </p>
    <h3>Dimension Properties</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><u>XYZ:</u> The XYZ dimensions directly correspond to the simulations XYZ.</p>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><u>Channel:</u> The different channels represent the variables exported,
                and the last channel <b>always</b> represents the geometric domains for your spatial export.
                </p>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><u>Time:</u> Time directly corresponds to the simulations time.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Accessing Simulation Results</h3>
        <p>For VCell exports generated from your local VCell installation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Select the appropriate export and click the "Open" button.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>From N5 URL (VCell Install Not Required):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the 'Remote Files' button, paste the N5 URL, and click open.</li>
        </ul>
